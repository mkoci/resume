                <h4>Technical Team Lead <span class="dates">(Feb 2024 – Feb 2025)</span></h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Launched and Scaled the Scala Computing Network Emulation Service:</strong> Developed a
                        multi-tenant datacenter emulation platform enabling network and sales engineers to emulate
                        complex network topologies in the cloud.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optimized VM Orchestration:</strong> Reduced deployment time for 30-VM topologies from
                        over 25 minutes to ~7 minutes by designing a Firecracker-based deployer service that dynamically
                        scaled based on resource demands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Streamlined Bare-Metal Readiness:</strong> Redesigned pool clusters and introduced a
                        “cold pool” strategy, slashing bare-metal server readiness from 10 minutes to 10 seconds—a 100×
                        improvement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Resource Allocation:</strong> Developed core deployment algorithm to predict and
                        allocate the optimal number of deployers (via Pulumi within Firecracker VMs) based on workload
                        size, ensuring efficient vCPU and memory utilization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secured End-to-End Connectivity:</strong> Engineered an integrated SSH solution using
                        Headscale/Tailscale authenticated through AWS Cognito, enabling secure, on-demand VM
                        authentication across multi-tenant environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Drove Enterprise Partnerships:</strong> Engaged directly with Keysight Technologies and
                        Juniper Networks, leading to multi-million-dollar future usage commitments and successful
                        integration of our backend services into their product ecosystems.</li>
